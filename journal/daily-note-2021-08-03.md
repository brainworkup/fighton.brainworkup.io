## Website Changes

I changed brainworkup.net and joeytrampush.com to CloudFare
I paid for them, but not sure how much overall
I registered brainworkup.io with DreamHost; cost was $29.99/year
  - still need to add DNS to CloudFare ... wasn't registered yet ... check back in a few days

TODO #1
check back with cloudfare in next few days
