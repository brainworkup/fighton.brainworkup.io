BRAINWORKUP NEUROPSYCHOLOGY CLINIC | Los Angeles, CA

BrainWorkup, LLC is a pediatric and adult clinical neuropsychology practice.  Our mission is to better educate our community about neurocognitive functioning and the importance of monitoring our own brain health.  We are trained in developmental neuropsychology, and as such, have the capacity to evaluate anyone in any stage of life, from children to teens to older adults.

Your initial evaluation will serve as a baseline benchmark of neurocognitive functioning.  Any follow-up evaluations you undergo here or elsewhere can then be compared to your baseline results in order to track changes in neurocognitive functions over time.  Serial evaluations are often of clinical value.  Using these quantitative test instruments, we can evaluate the effects of a particular treatment, surgical procedure or passage of time; and monitor recovery, deterioration or stabilization of function.  Importantly, we only use evidence-based tests grounded in contemporary neuroscientific research.

Performance on the neurocognitive tests that we use has remarkable predictive value across a diverse range of social, health and behavioral outcomes (Deary et al., 2011).  As examples, neurocognitive performance has been shown to be a better predictor of mortality from heart disease than smoking, blood glucose and cholesterol (Batty et al., 2008), can predict how long people live (Deary, 2008), and is associated with educational attainment and earned income (Johnson et al., 2009).  Furthermore, deficits in neurocognitive performance are pervasive in most psychiatric (e.g., ADHD and depression) and neurologic (e.g., dementia and Parkinson’s disease) disorders (Millan et al., 2012).  As such, the results of your workup will allow us to provide you with objective information for improving and/or maintaining your cognitive and emotional well being.

Understanding and monitoring neurocognitive functioning in everyone is critical to improving health outcomes as a society.  For these reasons, we want you to become an advocate of your own brain health.  Our goal is to have this fundamental medical data be available to anyone of any age, easy to get, affordable to all, and part of your regular health record.
