bio: I'm pretty much a neuroscientist who studies how genetics shape our behavior and risk for psychiatric illness, pretty much a developmental neuropsychologist who sees kids and young adults referred for a wide range of cognitive difficulties, and lately have been trying to become a data scientist.

My research interests include brain-behavior relationships, neurodevelopment,
and the molecular genetic architecture of neurocognitive functions; and novel
methods to communicate this work to the public.
