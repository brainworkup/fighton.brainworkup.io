I'm a neuroscientist who studies how genetics shape our behavior and risk for psychiatric illness; a developmental neuropsychologist who sees patients referred for a wide-range of cognitive difficulties; and a supporter of open-source data science.

<!-- My research interests include brain-behavior relationships, neurodevelopment,
and the molecular genetic architecture of neurocognitive functions; and novel
methods to communicate this work to the public. -->
