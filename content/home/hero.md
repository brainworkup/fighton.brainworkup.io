<!-- I have some expertise in the evaluation and diagnosis of neurodevelopmental disorders including ADHD, autism and learning problems; sports-related brain injury; and neuropsychiatric illness, especially those that emerge during early adulthood. I try to be an active researcher who studies brain and neurocognitive functioning in psychiatric illness as well as trying to figure out the underlying genetic architecture of brain development. -->
